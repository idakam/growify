## Reflection

### 1. What went well during this unit?

Creating wireframes helped us visualize key features and the user flow, making it easier to align on the app's functionality and design. We successfully designed three essential pages for Growify: the Dashboard, Skills Path, and Challenges pages. Additionally, drafting the Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) clarified how our database should be structured, which will be useful for backend development.

### 2. What were some challenges your group faced in this unit?

One of the main challenges was designing an ERD that effectively represents all the relationships without becoming too complex. We had to adjust our initial database structure a few times to ensure it supported features like tracking streaks and achievements. Also, building wireframes that visually conveyed the tree growth concept was tricky, as we wanted to make sure users would intuitively understand the progression.

### 3. What additional support will you need in upcoming units as you continue to work on your final project?

Support with the frontend framework to bring our wireframes to life would be helpful, particularly for implementing dynamic elements like the tree customization feature. Lastly, feedback on our pitch presentation would be beneficial to ensure we're effectively communicating the appâ€™s value and features.
